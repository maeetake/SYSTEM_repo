## Generate Python Code for Module: train_models

Please generate Python module code based on the detailed specifications below. Ensure strict adherence to all specified requirements and accurately reflect the provided examples. If there are any ambiguities or contradictions in the specifications, use comments in the code to explain the reasoning and adopt a solution that prioritizes functionality and clarity.

**1. Model Overview:**

* **Role and Purpose:** The purpose of this module is to use the training dataset to teach the LSTM and Transformer models the underlying patterns of stock price movements. By iteratively adjusting their internal weights based on a loss function, the models learn to predict the next day's closing price. The validation set is used concurrently to prevent overfitting, ensuring that the models generalize well to data they have not been trained on. This module produces the two core artifacts: the trained models.

**3. Input/Output Specifications:**

* **Input Format (with examples):**
    Inputs (`X_train`, `y_train`, `X_val`, `y_val`) must be NumPy arrays of type `numpy.float32`. The model input must be a compiled instance of `tf.keras.Model` or a `torch.nn.Module` with a defined forward pass.
* **Data Head (example):**
```
    Date  Open  High  Low  Close
2020/1/2  5.97  6.00 5.92   6.00
2020/1/3  5.88  5.95 5.85   5.90
2020/1/6  5.81  5.93 5.78   5.93
2020/1/7  5.96  6.04 5.91   6.00
2020/1/8  5.99  6.05 5.95   6.01
2020/1/9  6.10  6.15 6.02   6.08
```
* **Data Path:**
    C:\Users\T25ma\OneDrive\Desktop\AUTO_SYSTEM_Gemini\UNITTEST_DATA\generated\expected_input.csv
* **Expected Output Format (with examples):**
    r'The primary outputs are the trained model object and a history object/dictionary. The trained model should be saved to disk in the framework's standard format (e.g., .h5 for Keras). The history object's data (training/validation loss) must be accessible for the `visualize_results` module.'

**4. Constraints and Dependencies:**
* **Library Versions and Configurations:**
    Use TensorFlow >= 2.10 or PyTorch >= 1.12. Training should be configured to use a GPU if available to accelerate the process. The Adam optimizer is recommended.
* **Error Handling Requirements (specific errors to handle and how):**
    Log start and end of training for each model. At each epoch, log the training and validation loss to a file or standard output for real-time monitoring. Implement EarlyStopping to halt training if validation loss does not improve for a set number of epochs (e.g., 10), preventing wasted computation and overfitting.

**6. Implementation Guidelines:**

* **Data Retrieval Instructions:** Implement the process to load the dataset using the provided `data_path`. Adapt the retrieval method to the data source (e.g., CSV, JSON, database, or API). Ensure the program checks the validity of `data_path` and automatically loads the data without user intervention. If the file is missing or corrupted, handle errors with informative messages. Optionally, provide mock data for testing purposes to allow the program to proceed. ```python
import pandas as pd
import os

def load_data(data_path: str):
    if not os.path.exists(data_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"Error: File not found at {data_path}")
    try:
        # Adjust loading logic based on file type
        if data_path.endswith('.csv'):
            return pd.read_csv(data_path)
        elif data_path.endswith('.json'):
            return pd.read_json(data_path)
        else:
            raise ValueError("Unsupported file format. Please provide a CSV or JSON file.")
    except Exception as e:
        raise ValueError(f"Error loading data: {e}")
```
* **main Function Instructions:** Implement a main function as the program's entry point. The main function should be designed to execute without requiring any user input during runtime. Use the provided `data_path` to automatically load the necessary data. If the data is missing or the path is incorrect, handle errors with informative messages and provide mock data as a fallback if specified. ```python
def main():
    # Use default data path to automatically load data
    data_path = 'C:\Users\T25ma\OneDrive\Desktop\AUTO_SYSTEM_Gemini\UNITTEST_DATA\generated\expected_input.csv'

    # Load the data using the specified data path
    try:
        df = load_data(data_path)
        print("Data loaded successfully. Head of the data:")
        print(df.head())
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("Data file not found. Please check the data path or provide valid data.")
        # Optional: Use mock data if necessary
        mock_data = pd.DataFrame({"column1": [0, 1, 2], "column2": ["sample1", "sample2", "sample3"]})
        print("Using mock data:")
        print(mock_data.head())
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```
* **Clarity and Readability:** Prioritize clear, concise, and well-commented code. Use descriptive variable names and function names.
* **Modularity and Reusability:** Design the code for modularity and reusability, considering potential future extensions.
* **Thorough Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling as specified in the `Error Handling Requirements` section, using appropriate exception classes and informative error messages. Include try-except blocks where necessary.
* **Dependency Management:** If the module requires specific external libraries, clearly indicate these dependencies as comments at the beginning of the code. For example: `# Requires: pandas >= 1.0.0`
* **Adherence to Specifications:** Ensure the generated code strictly adheres to the provided specifications. If any adjustments are necessary due to conflicting or ambiguous information, clearly document the rationale behind these changes in comments.
* **Type Hinting (Recommended):** Use type hinting to improve code readability and maintainability.
