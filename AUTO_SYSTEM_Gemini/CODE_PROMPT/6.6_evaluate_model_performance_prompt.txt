## Generate Python Code for Module: evaluate_model_performance

Please generate Python module code based on the detailed specifications below. Ensure strict adherence to all specified requirements and accurately reflect the provided examples.

**1. Model Overview:**

* **Role and Purpose:** The purpose of this module is to provide a quantitative and objective evaluation of the trained LSTM and Transformer models. By calculating standard error metrics like RMSE and MAE on the test set, it determines the predictive accuracy of each model, which is essential for comparing them and selecting the superior one for deployment.
* **Overall Specification:**

        return {}


**6. Implementation Guidelines:**

* **Data Retrieval Instructions:** Implement the process to load the dataset using the provided `data_path`. Adapt the retrieval method to the data source (e.g., CSV, JSON, database, or API). Ensure the program checks the validity of `data_path` and automatically loads the data without user intervention. If the file is missing or corrupted, handle errors with informative messages. Optionally, provide mock data for testing purposes to allow the program to proceed. ```python
import pandas as pd
import os

def load_data(data_path: str):
    if not os.path.exists(data_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"Error: File not found at {data_path}")
    try:
        # Adjust loading logic based on file type
        if data_path.endswith('.csv'):
            return pd.read_csv(data_path)
        elif data_path.endswith('.json'):
            return pd.read_json(data_path)
        else:
            raise ValueError("Unsupported file format. Please provide a CSV or JSON file.")
    except Exception as e:
        raise ValueError(f"Error loading data: {e}")
```
* **main Function Instructions:** Implement a main function as the program's entry point. The main function should be designed to execute without requiring any user input during runtime. Use the provided `data_path` to automatically load the necessary data. If the data is missing or the path is incorrect, handle errors with informative messages and provide mock data as a fallback if specified. ```python
def main():
    # Use default data path to automatically load data
    data_path = 'C:\Users\T25ma\OneDrive\Desktop\AUTO_SYSTEM_Gemini\UNITTEST_DATA\generated\expected_input.csv'

    # Load the data using the specified data path
    try:
        df = load_data(data_path)
        print("Data loaded successfully. Head of the data:")
        print(df.head())
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("Data file not found. Please check the data path or provide valid data.")
        # Optional: Use mock data if necessary
        mock_data = pd.DataFrame({"column1": [0, 1, 2], "column2": ["sample1", "sample2", "sample3"]})
        print("Using mock data:")
        print(mock_data.head())
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```
* **Clarity and Readability:** Prioritize clear, concise, and well-commented code. Use descriptive variable names and function names.
* **Modularity and Reusability:** Design the code for modularity and reusability, considering potential future extensions.
* **Thorough Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling as specified in the `Error Handling Requirements` section, using appropriate exception classes and informative error messages. Include try-except blocks where necessary.
* **Dependency Management:** If the module requires specific external libraries, clearly indicate these dependencies as comments at the beginning of the code. For example: `# Requires: pandas >= 1.0.0`
* **Adherence to Specifications:** Ensure the generated code strictly adheres to the provided specifications. If any adjustments are necessary due to conflicting or ambiguous information, clearly document the rationale behind these changes in comments.
* **Type Hinting (Recommended):** Use type hinting to improve code readability and maintainability.
