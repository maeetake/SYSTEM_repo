## Generate Python Code for Module: split_dataset

Please generate Python module code based on the detailed specifications below. Ensure strict adherence to all specified requirements and accurately reflect the provided examples. If there are any ambiguities or contradictions in the specifications, use comments in the code to explain the reasoning and adopt a solution that prioritizes functionality and clarity.

**1. Model Overview:**

* **Role and Purpose:** The purpose of this module is to prepare the dataset for the model training and evaluation stages. By creating chronologically distinct subsets (training, validation, test), it simulates a real-world forecasting scenario where a model learns from the past to predict the future. This strict separation prevents data leakage and ensures an unbiased assessment of the model's performance on unseen data.
* **Overall Specification:**

        "Build two separate deep learning models: one using LSTM and another using a Transformer architecture.",
        "Train both models on the training set, using the validation set to monitor performance and prevent overfitting.",

    import numpy as np
from typing import Dict, Tuple, List

def split_sequential_data(X: np.ndarray, y: np.ndarray, split_ratios: Tuple[float, float, float] = (0.8, 0.1, 0.1)) -> Dict[str, np.ndarray]:
    """

    Args:

        y (np.ndarray): The target values.
        split_ratios (Tuple[float, float, float]): The ratios for train, validation, and test sets.

    Returns:
        Dict[str, np.ndarray]: A dictionary containing the split datasets.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If X and y have mismatched lengths or if the dataset is too small.
    """
    if X.shape[0] != y.shape[0]:
        raise ValueError("Input arrays X and y must have the same number of samples.")

    total_samples = X.shape[0]
    train_ratio, val_ratio, test_ratio = split_ratios

    if not np.isclose(train_ratio + val_ratio + test_ratio, 1.0):
        raise ValueError("Split ratios must sum to 1.0.")

    train_split_idx = int(total_samples * train_ratio)
    val_split_idx = int(total_samples * (train_ratio + val_ratio))

    if train_split_idx == 0 or val_split_idx == train_split_idx or val_split_idx == total_samples:
        raise ValueError(f"Insufficient data for splitting. Total samples: {total_samples}. Cannot create non-empty train/val/test sets with the given ratios.")

    X_train, y_train = X[:train_split_idx], y[:train_split_idx]
    X_val, y_val = X[train_split_idx:val_split_idx], y[train_split_idx:val_split_idx]

        'X_test': X_test,
        'y_test': y_test
    }


**6. Implementation Guidelines:**

* **Data Retrieval Instructions:** Implement the process to load the dataset using the provided `data_path`. Adapt the retrieval method to the data source (e.g., CSV, JSON, database, or API). Ensure the program checks the validity of `data_path` and automatically loads the data without user intervention. If the file is missing or corrupted, handle errors with informative messages. Optionally, provide mock data for testing purposes to allow the program to proceed. ```python
import pandas as pd
import os

def load_data(data_path: str):
    if not os.path.exists(data_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"Error: File not found at {data_path}")
    try:
        # Adjust loading logic based on file type
        if data_path.endswith('.csv'):
            return pd.read_csv(data_path)
        elif data_path.endswith('.json'):
            return pd.read_json(data_path)
        else:
            raise ValueError("Unsupported file format. Please provide a CSV or JSON file.")
    except Exception as e:
        raise ValueError(f"Error loading data: {e}")
```
* **main Function Instructions:** Implement a main function as the program's entry point. The main function should be designed to execute without requiring any user input during runtime. Use the provided `data_path` to automatically load the necessary data. If the data is missing or the path is incorrect, handle errors with informative messages and provide mock data as a fallback if specified. ```python
def main():
    # Use default data path to automatically load data
    data_path = 'C:\Users\T25ma\OneDrive\Desktop\AUTO_SYSTEM_Gemini\UNITTEST_DATA\generated\expected_input.csv'

    # Load the data using the specified data path
    try:
        df = load_data(data_path)
        print("Data loaded successfully. Head of the data:")
        print(df.head())
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("Data file not found. Please check the data path or provide valid data.")
        # Optional: Use mock data if necessary
        mock_data = pd.DataFrame({"column1": [0, 1, 2], "column2": ["sample1", "sample2", "sample3"]})
        print("Using mock data:")
        print(mock_data.head())
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```
* **Clarity and Readability:** Prioritize clear, concise, and well-commented code. Use descriptive variable names and function names.
* **Modularity and Reusability:** Design the code for modularity and reusability, considering potential future extensions.
* **Thorough Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling as specified in the `Error Handling Requirements` section, using appropriate exception classes and informative error messages. Include try-except blocks where necessary.
* **Dependency Management:** If the module requires specific external libraries, clearly indicate these dependencies as comments at the beginning of the code. For example: `# Requires: pandas >= 1.0.0`
* **Adherence to Specifications:** Ensure the generated code strictly adheres to the provided specifications. If any adjustments are necessary due to conflicting or ambiguous information, clearly document the rationale behind these changes in comments.
* **Type Hinting (Recommended):** Use type hinting to improve code readability and maintainability.
